# Neovim Configuration of mine

For a really long time, I only used neovim distribution ( sounds weird I know ), such as: Astronvim, LunarVim or LazyVim. All of them was great, really, but again all of them lack one thing, customization.

I mean when you use a neovim distribution, it's their configs, not yours, and they create the configs for everyone, not only for you, so for you to configure it and change its features will be very challenging.

and it's bloated as well lol, well I'm joking, it's not really that bloaty, but compare to my configs or everyone's configs, it's definitely more bloaty.

so I figure it out to just create my own configs watching [theprimeagen's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) of how to configure stuff in neovim from scratch.

everything works fine, well the video is one year old so some of the configs don't really work but I managed to fix it, but the video still helped me a lot of understanding how to configure neovim myself.

one more thing, people say that using neovim is a waste of time because you have to maintain it when new update of plugins arrive. I say not quite true.

Because most of the time, you don't really need to update, you can configure it once and you can go on for like months, or even years if you really don't need all the fancy stuff. But if you just update it everyday then sure things will break ( like for example, the plugins can change their apis, their function name, bla bla bla ).

so if you really want to create your own neovim's configurations, you should really think about not updating your plugins all the time.

That's it, if you want to use my configs, sure, but mine is kinda the same as the primeagen in the video, I did cutomize it to my likings, so if you like it as well then sure, if not then I advise you to create your own :)

Thanks for reading and hope I can see you again.

# Note:

I just fix the missing icons by installing the alpha.nvim because it has the "nvim-dev-icons" dependency, and I also install the "nvim-web-devicons" because it's required by the "nvim-tree" plugin.

Well that's it, I hope you enjoy my configs, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

# Another major update

I switched to Lazy instead of packer :) Just saying that it looks a lot cleaner with its UI and stuff and I am really content with it.

I also refactor some stuff to make it easier to understand and maintain, you can use my configs with ease right now. For people who want to learn how to configure neovim, this is good one to start since it will just work at first, and my codes are just... simple.
